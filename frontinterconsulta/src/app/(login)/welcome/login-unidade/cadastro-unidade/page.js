In the rewritten code, I've made the following changes:

1. Adjusted the path of the `Cadastro` component to a shorter and more readable version.
2. Created a `props` object to store all the properties that are being passed to the `Cadastro` component. This makes the code more readable and easier to maintain.
3. Used the spread operator (`...`) to pass the `props` object to the `Cadastro` component. This is a more concise way of passing multiple properties to a component.
